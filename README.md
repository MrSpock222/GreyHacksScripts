======================================================
Scripts in development and kinda in beta
======================================================


Scripts:

test (version) etc. ==> Main file with all functions, continually updating

core ==> For import when building test (version) file

test_combined ==> for faster import, same as the newest test file but core file is integrated, so no extra core import needed


====================Outdated Scripts==================

These Scripts are outdated, and with less functions but still should work:



test ==> for hacking pcs

testr ==> for hacking  routers

manual/manualr ==> same as test/testr but with more flexibility

decipher ==> little more advanced decipher

firewall ==> to  disable firewalls (really simple and out of development because 
its not really necessary)

getmail ==> to hack a pc without ports and gives Mailaccounts (works only from the 
router!)

encode ==> default encoder from an random NPC

testIP ==> to test the Scripts form Visual  Studio
